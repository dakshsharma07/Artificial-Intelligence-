# Project 3: Ghostbusters: Tracking

## Introduction

In this project, I designed Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. You'll advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.

### Concepts Explored

**1.** Probabilistic Inference

**2.** Belief Updating

**3.** State Representation and Updating

**4.** Agent Initialization and Registration

**5.**

### Files I edited
