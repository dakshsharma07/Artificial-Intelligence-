# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Projects from CS 3600: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2024)

## Course Description
The course covers intelligent search, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), probabilistic reasoning, and neural networks. In particular, I utilized methods and tools to build complete systems that can interact intelligently with their environment by learning and reasoning about the world.

## Projects
**1. Search in Pacman:** Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.

**2. Reinforcement Learning:** Implementation of value iteration and Q-learning

**3. Ghostbusters:** Designing Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisibile ghosts using inference, belief distributions, and greedy strategy.

**4. Neural Nets:** Implemenation of a multi layer neural net, including feed forward and backward propagation functions.
