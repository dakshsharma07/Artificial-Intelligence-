# Project 1: Search

## Introduction

In this project, my Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I built general search algorithms and applied them to Pacman scenarios.

## Concepts Explored

**1.** Intelligent Search

**2.** DFS (Stack), BFS (Queue), UCS (Priority Queue), A* Search (Priority Queue) Methods 

**3.** Heruistics

**4.** Graph Search vs. Tree Search

**5.** Frontier Management

**6.** Manhattan Distance

**7.** Agent Design

**8.** Expansion Tracking
