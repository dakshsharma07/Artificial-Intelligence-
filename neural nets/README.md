# Project 4: Neural Nets

## Introduction

In this project, I implemented neural nets, and in particular the most common
algorithm for learning the correct weights for a neural net from examples. Code structure was
provided for a Perceptron and a multi layer NeuralNet class, and I was responsible for filling
in some missing functions in each of these classes. This includes writing code for the feed
forward processing of input, as well as the backward propagation algorithm to update network
weights.
