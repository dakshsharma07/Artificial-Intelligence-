# Project 2: Reinforcement

## Introduction

In this project, I implemented value iteration and Q-learning. I tested my agents first on Gridworld (from class), then applied them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

### Files I edited

valueIterationAgents.py:	   A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.

qlearningAgents.py:    	Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.

analysis.py:    A file to put my answers to questions given in the project.
